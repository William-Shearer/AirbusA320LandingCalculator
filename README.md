# AirbusA320LandingCalculator
Simple HTML/JS tool for computing A-320 landing distances.
## JavaScript programming practice project.  
The user will select the conditions of the aircraft and landing airfield/runway, and hit execute. The solution of the distance required for the landing is provided in feet.  
The program, even though the data is taken from a valid and operational A-320 QRH, is NOT to be used for actual landing calculations. This is a warning, in case any A-320 pilot finds themselves on this page.
